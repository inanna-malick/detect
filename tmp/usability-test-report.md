# Detect MCP Tool - Comprehensive Usability Testing Report

## Executive Summary

The detect MCP tool demonstrates **strong foundational usability** for LLM interactions but has several critical issues that prevent optimal AI assistant experience. The error handling system is exceptionally well-designed with clear grammar guides, but documentation accessibility and consistency issues create unnecessary friction.

**Overall LLM Usability Score: B+** (Could easily reach A+ with targeted fixes)

## Key Findings

### ✅ **Exceptional Strengths**
1. **Error Messages**: Every parse error includes position indicators and comprehensive grammar guides
2. **Syntax Consistency**: Clean, logical syntax that's easy for LLMs to learn
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Natural progression from simple to complex queries
4. **Performance**: Handles large codebases efficiently

### 🚨 **Critical Issues (High Priority)**
1. **MCP Documentation Gap**: No accessible `detect_help` tool for comprehensive documentation
2. **Inconsistent Operator Documentation**: Tool accepts both `=` and `==` but docs only show `==`
3. **Outdated Error References**: Error messages reference deprecated `@Size` syntax
4. **Silent Wildcard Failures**: Shell-style `*.rs` patterns fail silently instead of suggesting regex

### ⚠️ **Major Issues (Medium Priority)**
1. **Selector Ambiguity**: No guidance on when to use `name` vs `path` vs `contents`
2. **Case Sensitivity Unclear**: Case-sensitive behavior not documented in error messages
3. **Size Units Unsupported**: Human-readable `1MB` not supported, must use bytes
4. **Quote Usage Ambiguity**: When quotes are required vs optional isn't clear

## Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Testing
- Tested all selectors and operators with various inputs
- Assessed error message quality and actionability
- Evaluated documentation accessibility
- Tested edge cases and boundary conditions

### Phase 2: LLM-Specific Usability Testing
- Simulated common AI assistant mistakes
- Tested error recovery patterns
- Assessed cognitive load for complex queries
- Identified misconception-prone areas

## Detailed Findings

### Error Handling Excellence
The error system is **exceptionally well-designed** for LLM usage:
- **Position Indicators**: Exact column numbers for parse errors
- **Grammar Guides**: Comprehensive syntax help included with every error
- **Examples**: Clear, copy-pasteable examples in error messages
- **Consistency**: Predictable error format across all error types

### Documentation Accessibility Crisis
While excellent documentation exists (`src/docs/mcp_*.md`), it's **completely inaccessible** through the MCP interface:
- No `detect_help` tool exposed to users
- Rich documentation content exists but can't be discovered
- Users must rely solely on error messages for learning

### LLM-Specific Challenges
1. **Operator Precedence**: Complex boolean expressions need parentheses guidance
2. **Wildcard Expectations**: LLMs naturally try `*.rs` (shell syntax) instead of regex
3. **Natural Language Patterns**: Attempts at `files modified today` instead of `modified > "today"`
4. **Case Sensitivity Assumptions**: LLMs may assume case-insensitive matching
5. **Size Unit Expectations**: Human-readable units (`1KB`, `1MB`) are expected

## Improvement Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Can implement now)
1. **Fix Error Message Consistency**
   - Remove `@Size` references from error messages
   - Document both `=` and `==` in error guides
   - Add case sensitivity note to error hints

2. **Expose MCP Documentation**
   - Fix `detect_help` tool accessibility issue
   - Ensure comprehensive documentation is discoverable

3. **Add Wildcard Detection**
   - Detect shell-style wildcards (`*`, `?`) in patterns
   - Suggest regex alternatives in error messages

### Enhanced Features (Moderate effort)
1. **Size Unit Support**
   - Accept `1KB`, `1MB`, `1GB` formats
   - Convert to bytes internally

2. **Improved Error Suggestions**
   - When wildcard detected: "Use regex: `name ~= \".*\\.rs$\"`"
   - When case mismatch: "Try case-insensitive regex: `name ~= \"(?i)readme\"`"
   - When operator missing: "Did you mean: `name == README.md`?"

3. **Selector Disambiguation**
   - Add brief selector descriptions to error messages
   - Clarify `name` (filename) vs `path` (full path) vs `contents` (file contents)

### Future Enhancements (Lower priority)
1. **LLM-Specific Documentation Section**
2. **Query Validation Mode**
3. **Common Pattern Library**
4. **Interactive Query Builder**

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1-2 hours)
- ✅ Remove outdated `@Size` references
- ✅ Fix `detect_help` MCP accessibility
- ✅ Add wildcard detection suggestions
- ✅ Update error message consistency

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience (3-4 hours)
- Add size unit support (`1KB` → `1024`)
- Improve contextual error suggestions
- Add selector disambiguation
- Enhanced case sensitivity guidance

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- LLM-specific documentation
- Query validation and suggestions
- Interactive pattern building

## Success Metrics

After implementing improvements:
- **Reduced Error Recovery Time**: Users should reach successful queries faster
- **Fewer Repeated Errors**: Better guidance should prevent error loops
- **Higher Complex Query Success**: Better precedence and syntax guidance
- **Improved Self-Discovery**: Better documentation accessibility

## Conclusion

The detect MCP tool has **exceptional foundations** for LLM usability. The error handling system is already at A+ level, and the syntax is clean and learnable. The critical missing piece is **documentation accessibility** and a few consistency fixes.

With the recommended immediate fixes, this tool could become a **gold standard** for LLM-friendly command interfaces. The investment is minimal for the usability gain achieved.
