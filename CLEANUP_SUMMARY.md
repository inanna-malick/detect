# Cleanup Summary - LLM-Friendly Syntax Migration

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up the detect codebase by removing all deprecated syntax and dead code from the old parser implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updates (Commit: c747286)
- Updated CLAUDE.md to remove `@` prefix references
- Updated README.md with new syntax examples
- Fixed integration tests to use new predicate syntax
- Created CLEANUP_NOTES.md to document findings

### 2. Dead Code Removal (Commit: 8df5e9d)
- Removed `RawPredicate` struct and its parse method
- Removed old `Selector` enum (superseded by query.rs implementation)
- Removed `Op` and `NumericalOp` enums
- Removed parsing functions: `parse_string`, `parse_string_dfa`, `parse_numerical`
- Removed `Bound` enum and simplified `NumberMatcher`
- Cleaned up unused imports

### 3. Test Updates
- Updated integration tests to use new LLM-friendly syntax
- Fixed test expectations to match new parser behavior
- Note: Some llm_syntax_tests still fail due to incomplete feature implementation

## Current State

### ✅ Clean
- All production code uses new syntax
- All documentation updated
- Integration tests passing
- No references to old `@` prefix syntax (except in NEW_SYNTAX.md for comparison)

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- Some advanced filter features not fully implemented (e.g., standalone predicates)
- llm_syntax_tests have failing cases for unimplemented features
- Binary file detection TODO remains
- Time filters TODO remains

## Verification
```bash
# No old syntax found
grep -r "@name\|@path\|@size" src/ tests/ *.md | grep -v NEW_SYNTAX.md
# Returns nothing

# All tests pass except known llm_syntax_tests
cargo test --test integration  # ✅ All pass
cargo test --lib              # ✅ All pass
```

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining filter features (time filters, binary detection)
2. Fix failing llm_syntax_tests or update them to match current implementation
3. Consider adding more integration tests for edge cases
